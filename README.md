ToiR mobile client application

MC MRO is a complex of software and hardware, which is a portable device that allows an employee from among the maintenance personnel to carry out the necessary inspection and service functions.

The mobile client is a device running the Android operating system with a built-in RFID / NFC tag reader, 1D and 2B Barcode, a GPS tracker, a GSM module and a camera for shooting (equipment may vary). MK can also interact via Bluetooth protocol with other measuring and reading devices: temperature meters (pyrometers), noise level, light sensors, vibration, external RFID readers.

This device is designed to work in conditions of varying degrees of difficulty in adverse weather conditions (snow, dust, rain). The software can work on a regular smartphone with Android OS version (API 16) or higher, without using RFID tags.

The mobile client receives work orders from the upstream server of the system, which is also part of the MRO software and hardware complex. After completing the order, its results, including photos, are sent to the server.

The main function of MC is the automation of equipment maintenance operations, control of bypasses, supply of maintenance personnel with comprehensive information and optimization of work time.
